# LinearSystemSolver
This program takes an n-dimensional matrix (lets call it A) and destructs it into its LU decomposition, namely the L and U lower and upper triangular matrices that compose it. 
It will then prompt the user for a solution vector b (from the form Ax = b) and solve for the x vector using backwards and forwards substitution with the L and U matrices.
